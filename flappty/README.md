# Flappty Burd

Legends tell of a developer who created a simple and slightly unfair mobile game that would take the world by storm. So mighty would that storm become, that they would be consumed by it. The developer vanished alongside their creation, never to be seen again.

(They probably just realized that their assets were not different enough from those of a certain former playing card manufacturer and cashed out...)

The game you see here is an even more crude version of the already slightly crude game that started the aforementioned storm. 

It was created in [Processing](https://processing.org).
