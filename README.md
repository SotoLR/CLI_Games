# CLI Games
A few games I have made for the command line (I reserve the right to include games that do not run solely on the CLI, if they are lightweight enough - which is *very*).

They have mainly been tested on Windows, but I have not used any libraries that are incompatible between operating systems yet, so I see no reason why they might not run on other OSs.

It's a bit sparse at the moment, but I want to create a few more, such as Tetris, BlackJack, Snake, and Sudoku.

I would also like to implement some sort of GUI, most likely using a Curses module or library.

As for the reason? Fun, mostly. I like to imagine what it was like to implement these games back before game engines and such existed.
